# CareDash Intern Application Lucas Rosenblatt

##The Front End: HTML/CSS/Javascript

I built the CareDash wireframe that was assigned to me using Bootstrap and a touch of jQuery. 

I decided not to implement the login logic in javascript because that form of validation (hosting any form of directly accessible .js) is incredibly insecure. (for the record, I spent my past summer prototyping primarily using javascript, and consider myself very well-versed in the language)

##The Backend: Python/Flask/SQLAlchemy
I built the backend using flask-sqlalchemy. I tried to show a few of the different methods for querying dbs.

I wrote up the bash script provided, and tested 

##Overall
I really enjoyed this challenge! I find turning wireframes into HTML/CSS to be incredibly satisfying, and I think flask-sqlalchemy is one of the best databasing solutions currently available (I almost solely use it above similar software).

I'm so excited to hear back, and hopefully join the team :D

If you have any questions for me about my implementation (how I would do this, why I chose to do that), please let me know!
